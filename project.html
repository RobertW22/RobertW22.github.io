        <p>
            <p>We had a fantastic opportunity to delve into the topic of AI at Amazon's DeepRacer event. 
              In order to train our AI models to navigate as quickly as possible around a track with total reliance on the AI model, 
              we had three weeks to create and develop a reward system for our AI model. 
              Weeks of training, model adjustments, and virtually testing the lap time later, my partner and I were invited to the finals held at the University of Sydney.
              With a laptime of 7 seconds, we finished first out of 40 participants 
              and were awarded a very generous $250 worth of Amazon merchandise.
              
              This event was also held at a nearby university 'University of Technology' where we beat their winning time of 13 seconds by almost half!

        <p>
            <p>In order to deepen my understanding of data structures, I constructed an airport system using an adjacency list representation as I was having trouble completely comprehending graphs.
              The program gives the user complete control over features including showing the number of airports, adding airports,
              adding flight paths between airports, getting all flights departing from a particular airport, and listing all airport names.

        <p>
            <p>Trading and the stock market are great interests of mine. 
              I wanted to incorporate one of my favourite abstract data structures into this project because I'm intrigued by development from a trading perspective. 
              The engine employs the 'Priority Queue' ADT, and the management of buy and sell orders is done using min and max heaps. 
              A trade is carried out and executed if the asking buy order value is more than or equal to the selling order value, which is determined by comparing the min & max of the heaps.

        <p>
            <p>This project was a cheat trainer for a game called "Faster Than Light" that I made in C#.
            The program consisted of lots of memory manipulation to write my own memory to
            pointers which would change the values of variables within the games code to take control of the game.</p>
          
            <p>Along side coding the program, I created a GUI using forms in Visual Studio to make the program more user friendly.</p>

        <p>
            <p>Coding this website has increased my confidence in HTML and CSS tremendously! I also really enjoyed delving into the design aspect of programming. </p>
          
            <p>A lot of the knowledge used to create this site was gained at a workshop hosted at the Google office in Sydney. It was an amazing experience, and I look forward to many more through my university's very own 'Google Student Development Club'.</p>
