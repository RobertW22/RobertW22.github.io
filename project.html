        <p>
            <p>To further my understanding of data structures, I implemented an airport system using an adjacency list representation as Graphs were
              a data structure that I found my self struggling to fully grasp. The program allows for full control to the user for functions such as, display number of airports,
              add airports, add flight path between airports, get all flights available from a specific airport, and list all airports names.

        <p>
            <p>Trading and the stock market are great interests of mine. 
              I wanted to incorporate one of my favourite abstract data structures into this project because I'm intrigued by development from a trading perspective. 
              The engine employs the 'Priority Queue' ADT, and the management of buy and sell orders is done using min and max heaps. 
              A trade is carried out and executed if the asking buy order value is more than or equal to the selling order value, which is determined by comparing the min & max of the heaps.

        <p>
            <p>This project was a cheat trainer for a game called "Faster Than Light" that I made in C#.
            The program consisted of lots of memory manipulation to write my own memory to
            pointers which would change the values of variables within the games code to take control of the game.</p>
          
            <p>Along side coding the program, I created a GUI using forms in Visual Studio to make the program more user friendly.</p>

        <p>
            <p>Coding this website has increased my confidence in HTML and CSS tremendously! I also really enjoyed delving into the design aspect of programming. </p>
          
            <p>A lot of the knowledge used to create this site was gained at a workshop hosted at the Google office in Sydney. It was an amazing experience, and I look forward to many more through my university's very own 'Google Student Development Club'.</p>
